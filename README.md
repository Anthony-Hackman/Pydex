**Pydex** is a powerful **Python-based command-line tool** that lets you instantly retrieve detailed information about any Pokémon. Built using data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), Pydex provides a clean, readable output right in your terminal, supporting queries by both **name** and **ID**.

## DexUI (Optional Graphical Interface)

For a visual experience, Pydex includes **DexUI**, a separate graphical user interface (GUI) built with the PyQt6 library.

### Features

* Search for Pokémon by **Name** or **ID**.
* Display **Type(s), Abilities, Base Stats,** and **Generation**.
* Show the official **Sprite Image URL**.
* Includes the official **flavor text** (fun fact) just like the original!

## Setup Instructions

To get Pydex running quickly, this project uses a standard `requirements.txt` file to manage all necessary libraries.

---

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+

* `pip` -  (Python package installer)

### Dependencies

* **`requests`** -  For making HTTP calls to the PokéAPI
* **`rich`** - For generating readable terminal output and tables
* **`typer`** - For building the command-line interface
* **`PyQt6`** - Required to run the graphical user interface (Optional, if not using DexUI.py).

To ensure the ease of installation, all of the above (excluding prerequisites) are included in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthony-hackman/Pydex.git
cd Pydex
   ```

## Install dependencies

Install all required packages (including the optional GUI library, PyQt6) using the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Usage

You can run the CLI application by entering the name of the file `pydex.py`, the function `search`, followed by the Pokémon's `Name` or `ID`.

```bash
<file> <function> <name_or_id>
```

For example, to search for the Pokémon `Charizard`, navigate to the directory containing the pydex repository and enter:

```bash
pydex.py search Charizard
```

To run the graphic user interface, simply run:

```bash
python DexUI.py
```

### Sample Output from CLI
